# Automatic Grammatical Tagger for a Spanish-Mixtec Parallel Corpus
It is an intelligent tagger of Spanish-Mixtec parallel corpora using CRF, LSTM and Transformers. It allows you to train new neural network and CRF models and then incorporate these new models into the application to generate labeled texts. This functionality allows you to have an intelligent labeler since the new data is added to the training data and allows you to improve precision.

The application is capable of generating synthetic text labels in the Mixtec language using GPT-4 and GPT-4O.
The tagged text generated is a useful resource for the development of technologies for other languages ​​with low digital resources, development of automatic translation systems, voice recognition, among other tools.
